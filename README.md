# POLAR background prediction

The idea of the project is to first predict the background part of a light curve (y axis being the number of photons arriving into the POLAR detector per second) or transformed
light curve. After this fitting the curve, we would like to subtract it from the original curve and use the resulting curve to detect gamma ray bursts (GRBs).
