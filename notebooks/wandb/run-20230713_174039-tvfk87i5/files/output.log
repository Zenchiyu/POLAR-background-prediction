Looks like the annotation(s) you are trying
to draw lies/lay outside the given figure size.
Therefore, the resulting Plotly figure may not be
large enough to view the full text. To adjust
the size of the figure, use the 'width' and
'height' keys in the Layout object. Alternatively,
use the Margin object to adjust the figure's margins.
